# DynamicGETTextToimage
Produces dynamic image from input text and params to GET request. Useful for GitHub profile embeds. Not sure why I couldn't find a single other person who has made this online so I made it myself.

Currently live on https://dynamicgettexttoimage.adaptable.app

GET Params:
- text (text to display)
- spigotuserid (special use case for myself to show my spigot downloads)
- width (width of image)
- height (height of image)
- fontsize (font size of text in image)
